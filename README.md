Link: [Digital Topics in Science and Industry - Dashboard](https://fractalds.shinyapps.io/digital_topics)

We aim through this dashboard to make available some insights on the propagation of digital technologies in research - both in science and in the industry.

## Presentation
This work has been performed with two datasets. The first is composed of scientific articles metadata that include digital keywords, either as a research target or as a tool for applied research. The second is the corollary for industrial research i.e. made of patents metadata. Data have been provided by M. MÃ¼ller and S. Bianchini - BETA Strasbourg. Scientific papers have been obtained from Clarivate (Web of Science).

# Known Issues / Further Improvements
- In Contribution and Evolution tabs, make the plot picker more user-friendly, i.e. get rid of choosing the plot by its filename.
- Include the light versions of Overview networks (these versions exist and can be found in the Github repository). See if it loads significantly faster compared to original networks.
- Manage plots dimensions. Right now the dashboard is well displayed on a 1080p format but without borders (the browser takes some place so we lack space). For now this issue can be solved by zooming out the web page to about 80%.
- In the Fields and Countries tab - in the sub-tabs Topics and World - the user has to manually select an option for the visualization to be loaded. The default plot does not load automatically.
- In the same tab, nodes names are quite small so the user has to zoom in to see them.
- In the Contributions tab, for inventors plots, several are not working because of path specification issues.
